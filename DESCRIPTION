Description: We introduce a simple mathematical framework that does not rely on traditional estimates of variance. Specifically, we combine estimates of the standardized within-gene variation in gene counts, the estimate of the overall magnitude of variation among genes and samples, and the log standardized mean expression of a gene into a single parameter, Î©.
